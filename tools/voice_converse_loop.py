"""Framework-agnostic off-device realtime voice loop primitives.

This is the neutral home of the VAD/STT/mic-shim core shared by every surface
that hosts a live "converse" WebSocket (the FastAPI dashboard router
:mod:`hermes_cli.web_routers._converse_loop` and the aiohttp gateway module
:mod:`gateway.platforms.api_server_converse`). Nothing here touches a socket, an
audio device, a live model or a specific web framework, so it can be unit-tested
in isolation.

Pieces:

* :class:`_NetworkMicStream` — a ``sounddevice``-shaped shim whose ``.read()``
  pulls int16 blocks from a thread-safe queue fed by a WebSocket. It lets the
  existing endpointer (:func:`tools.voice_mode._capture_until_quiet`) run
  unchanged against a network source instead of a local microphone.
* :class:`ConverseSession` — drives the reused VAD/STT loop on a worker thread:
  read 30 ms blocks, feed :class:`tools.voice_mode._BargeDetector`, and on a
  trip (speech onset) or silence endpoint capture the utterance, transcribe it
  and hand the transcript to the handler. It also owns the ``playing`` flag and
  barge-in (a trip while playing cuts TTS).
* :func:`split_text_for_tts_stream` — a provider-cap-aware sentence splitter, so
  a host that has no dashboard dependency can chunk a synthesized sentence
  without importing :mod:`hermes_cli.web_server_gateway`.

    * ``synth`` — a converse synthesizer (``.sample_rate`` + ``.synth(text) ->
      Iterator[bytes]``); ``cap`` — the provider's max text length.
    * ``history`` — the mutable conversation-history list; the driver appends the
      user + assistant message each turn and caps it to a bounded tail.

    BARGE-IN / v1 LIMITATION: a VAD trip while playing stops TTS PLAYBACK
    (``session`` sets ``tts_stop`` + ``mark_speech_interrupted``) and we emit
    ``{"type":"interrupted"}``, but the in-flight agent turn (``run_turn`` /
    ``_run_agent`` / ``prompt.submit``) is NOT cancelled in v1 — it is allowed to run
    to completion, so a barged turn may still finish and fire tools, and the next
    utterance queues behind it. Cancelling the in-flight turn is a deliberate
    follow-up, not implemented here.
